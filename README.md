Created this simple terraria mod for a no-hit playthrough with friends, but every no-hit mod out there broke in multiplayer, so I wrote my own.

In reality it isn't a true no-hit mod, it just boosts enemy damage to kill in one hit, but most dodge accessories still work

Still WIP with many features and improvement, maybe one day.
